## ESX Tool v2
Command line tool for manipulating contents of Ekahau .esx files

- Extracts ESX information to CSV / Updates ESX from CSV

- Swaps images between Ekahau files - update images with different sizes and rescale based on alignment points.

Example use case: Normalize ESX contents (e.g. AP Names) prior to DNA-C map upload


Verified on Ekahau AI Pro 11.4.0.1

### Command line options

#### --mapreplace [Project .esx file] [Map .esx file]

Replaces image from _new_ esx file into _project_ esx file (creates new esx file)

Images can be of different resolution

Floorplans must have the same name within Ekahau, supports multiple floorplan replacement simultaneously

Both .esx files need TWO matching floor alignment points for each floorplan

Re-aligns all APs based on coordinates calculated from alignment points

Floor alignment points are consumed (deleted) during the process

#### --tocsv [.esx file]

Dumps AP information from ESX to CSV

Parses both _Simulated_ and _Measured_ Ekahau files (but not both combined)

Saves two CSV files, AP data & map/floor data

#### --fromcsv [.esx file] [.csv file]

Updates ESX file using data from CSV template

Changes AP names and X/Y map coordinates

Will update AP name if new name is provided

Will update X/Y coordinates if new coordinates are provided (only if AP already has coordinates in Ekahau)

#### --template

Generates empty CSV template, used when importing into ESX
